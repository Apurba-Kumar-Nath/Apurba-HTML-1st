---My Website-> https://apurba-kumar-nath.github.io/Apurba-HTML-1st/  <- ---
This is the first website I created using HTML and CSS. I have learned some basics by reading beginners books, watching some beginner friendly YouTube videos and by watching some examples given in some websites like https://www.w3schools.com/ . Here, you will see some pictures I took by mobile phones. I've designed the page in a minimalistic way.
